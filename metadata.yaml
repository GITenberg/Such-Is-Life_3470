description: "Such Is Life: Being Certain Extracts From The Diary of Tom Collins is\
  \ a novel written by the Australian author Joseph Furphy (aka Tom Collins) in 1897,\
  \ and published on 1 August 1903. It is a fictional account of the life of rural\
  \ dwellers, including bullock drivers, squatters and itinerant travellers, in southern\
  \ New South Wales and Victoria, during the 1880s.\nThe book gives the impression\
  \ of being a series of loosely interwoven stories of the various people encountered\
  \ by the narrator as he travels about the countryside. The people he meets round\
  \ campfires pass on news and gossip and tell stories, so that sometimes the reader\
  \ can infer information by putting these second hand stories together with the action\
  \ of the narrative. At times the prose may be difficult for some modern readers\
  \ to understand because of the use of Australian vernacular and the attempt to convey\
  \ the accents of Scottish and Chinese personalities.\nThe title of Such Is Life\
  \ is said to be derived from Ned Kelly's last words—said as he was about to be hanged.\
  \ The book is full of mordant irony from start to finish, not least from the contrast\
  \ between the narration and the action—the narrator at times employing extremely\
  \ high blown language (and displaying Furphy's almost freakish degree of book-learning)\
  \ in humorous contrast to the extremely low characters and mundane events he is\
  \ describing. Furphy employs both pathos and bathos and the narration teases the\
  \ reader with its tangents, like a shaggy dog story. (The pseudonym 'Tom Collins'\
  \ is slang for a tall story.) There are hidden substories, and the narrator sometimes\
  \ gets hold of the wrong end of the stick in untangling them, but the reader can\
  \ nut them out. Subjects which occur in the book but are not spoken of directly\
  \ include: foul language; nakedness and undergarments; passing as the opposite sex;\
  \ homosexuality among bullock drivers; effeminacy; mutilation; and murder. At the\
  \ same time the great joy of the novel is its realism: Furphy is able to capture\
  \ the flavour of interaction between the bush characters he meets, their way of\
  \ talking, the physical landscape, the feel of a nomad's life. The 19th century\
  \ US novelist he is most similar in approach to is Mark Twain. With its use of a\
  \ digressive, unreliable narrator, Furphy's method in Such Is Life can be compared\
  \ with that of his Brazilian contemporary Machado de Assis.\n From Wikipedia (CC\
